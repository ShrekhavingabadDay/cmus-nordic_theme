## How do I use this theme?
- Make sure to put the nord.theme file from this repo into your ~/.config/cmus folder (or your preferred cmus config folder),
- and run this command inside cmus: `colorscheme: nord` !
- Hopefully it worked!

## Can I modify it?
Yes, go ahead, I've tried to comment it as good as possible, but it's a little incomplete.
